# SMU-MSDS-DS-7374-Final-Project

This Project is assigned to me - Samson Akomolafe and my temamate Joel Laskow by Dr Bivin Sadler as a requirement to fulfill the eompletion of the course - DS 7374 - Data Analytics.

The project focussed on improving the gross sales of a coffee shop using AI recommendation system.

Previously, upsales in being done by the cashier at the counter, but we are proposing to use AI chatbot going forward.

We came up with nice sales growth and we hope that management will accept our recommendations

Thank you.
